# Pilot timer

## What?
Simple app which will, hopefully in the future, allow me to track flight time without pen and paper. Instead just tap out a timer and display the time elapsed on the go.
Pilot timer will display following data:
* Date of flight
* Hour of Block Time start and end
* Hour of Flight Time start and end
* Elapsed time for Block Time
* Elapsed time for Flight Time

## Why?
I am almost sure there are existing solutions available online, but I am too cheap to buy ;)
